## This code snippet deals with generating a self-signed Root CA certificate and its private key in Go. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Constants:

FilePermission: Defines the file permissions for generated certificates (0644 - Read/Write for owner, Read-only for group and others).
caBitSize: Defines the key size for the RSA key used in the certificate (4096 bits).
OrgName: Defines the organization name for the certificate issuer ("Intelops").
RootCACommonName: Defines the common name for the Root CA certificate ("Capten Agent Root CA").
ClusterCACertSecretName: Defines the name of the Kubernetes Secret where the CA certificate will be stored ("agent-ca-cert").
CertManagerNamespace: Defines the namespace where Cert Manager is deployed ("cert-manager").
Structs:

Key: Represents a private key with its raw data.
Cert: Represents a certificate with its raw data.
CertificatesData: Holds the generated Root CA key, certificate, and its chain data.
Functions:

GenerateRootCerts: This function generates the Root CA certificate and its private key.

It calls generateCACert to create the key and certificate.
It returns a CertificatesData struct containing the generated key, certificate, and the certificate chain data (which is the same as the certificate data for a self-signed CA).
generateCACert: This function performs the core logic for generating the Root CA.

It generates a new RSA key using rsa.GenerateKey.
It creates a certificate template using x509.Certificate. The template defines various properties of the certificate:
Subject: Organization and Common Name.
Serial Number: Set to 1.
Validity Period: Starts from now and expires in 5 years.
IsCA: Set to true indicating it's a Certificate Authority.
Key Usage: Allowed for digital signature and certificate signing.
Basic Constraints Valid: Set to true for X.509 v3 certificate extensions.
It signs the certificate template with the generated key using x509.CreateCertificate.
It encodes the key and certificate data in PEM format using pem.EncodeToMemory.
It returns a Key and Cert struct containing the private key and certificate data respectively.
Overall, this code snippet provides a basic implementation for generating a self-signed Root CA certificate for internal usage.
