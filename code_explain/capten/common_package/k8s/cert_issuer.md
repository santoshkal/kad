## This code snippet focuses on managing certificates for the Kad service within a Kubernetes cluster. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

1. Setting Up CA Certificate Issuer:

The SetupCACertIssuser function creates a Cluster Issuer resource in Cert Manager for issuing TLS certificates signed by a self-generated Certificate Authority (CA).
It leverages the setupCertificateIssuer function to handle the creation or update process.
2. Creating or Updating Certificate Issuer:

The setupCertificateIssuer function performs the following steps:
Generates a new CA certificate and key pair.
Creates a ClusterIssuer object specifying the CA as the issuer for signed certificates.
Attempts to retrieve an existing ClusterIssuer with the specified name.
If the issuer doesn't exist, it creates a new one along with a corresponding secret containing the CA certificate and key.
If the issuer exists and forceUpdate is set to true, it updates the issuer spec to reference the newly generated certificates and updates the secret.
It stores the generated certificates data for potential use in Vault (a secrets management tool).
3. Managing CA Certificate Secret:

The CreateOrUpdateClusterCAIssuerSecret function creates or updates a Kubernetes Secret object named cluster-ca-cert containing the CA certificate, key, and certificate chain.
Overall, this code snippet ensures a self-signed CA and a corresponding Cluster Issuer resource exist in Cert Manager to allow signing certificates for the Kad service within the Kubernetes cluster.
