## This code defines the K8SClient struct and its functionalities for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

Configuration:

Configuration struct holds the path to the optional kubeconfig file used for authentication.
GetK8SConfig function retrieves the Kubernetes configuration based on:
Presence of a kubeconfig path in the environment variable KUBECONFIG_PATH.
If not set, it tries to use the in-cluster configuration for pods running within the Kubernetes cluster itself.
Client Creation:

NewK8SClient function creates a K8SClient instance with:
A logger object for logging messages.
Kubernetes API clientset for interacting with Kubernetes resources.
Dynamic client for interacting with arbitrary Kubernetes resources.
The loaded configuration.
NewK8SClientForCluster function allows creating a client for a specific cluster by providing kubeconfig, cluster CA certificate, and endpoint details.
Resource Management:

The K8SClient struct provides methods for interacting with various Kubernetes resources:
Pods: List pods in a namespace (ListPods).
ConfigMaps: Create, update, delete, and get ConfigMaps (CreateConfigmap, UpdateConfigmap, DeleteConfigmap, GetConfigmap).
Secrets: Get secret data, get a secret object, create or update secrets (GetSecretData, GetSecretObject, CreateOrUpdateSecret, CreateOrUpdateSecretObject, DeleteSecret).
Services: Get service data (GetServiceData).
Namespaces: Create and delete namespaces (CreateNamespace, DeleteNamespace).
Error Handling:

The provided methods handle potential errors during resource interactions with Kubernetes API server using k8serror.IsNotFound and k8serror.IsAlreadyExists for specific scenarios.
Overall, this code snippet provides a comprehensive K8S client implementation for interacting with various Kubernetes resources and managing their lifecycle.
