## This code defines a function RegisterDynamicInformers for setting up informers to watch for dynamic resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Arguments:

resEvtHandler: A cache.ResourceEventHandler interface implementation responsible for handling resource events (Add, Update, Delete).
client: A dynamic client interface used to interact with dynamic resources in the cluster.
gvr: A schema.GroupVersionResource struct specifying the Group, Version, and Resource type to watch.
Steps:

Create Dynamic Informer Factory:

It creates a dynamicinformer.NewDynamicSharedInformerFactory instance using the provided client and sets a default resync time of 60 seconds for periodic state synchronization.
Get Informer:

It retrieves an informer for the specified gvr from the informer factory.
Set Event Handlers:

It attaches the provided resEvtHandler to the informer for handling resource events (Add, Update, Delete).
Start Informer and Wait for Cache Sync:

It creates a channel (stop) to signal termination.
It starts all informers managed by the factory, including the one for the specified gvr.
It waits for the informer to synchronize its local cache with the cluster state using cache.WaitForCacheSync.
If the cache fails to synchronize within an unspecified timeout, it returns an error indicating the failure.
Return:

If the cache synchronization is successful, it returns nil.

Overall, this function simplifies setting up dynamic informers for watching specific Kubernetes resources and triggering custom logic based on resource lifecycle events.
