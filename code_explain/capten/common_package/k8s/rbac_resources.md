## This code snippet deals with managing Kubernetes Service Accounts and ClusterRoleBindings within the K8SClient struct.

1. CreateOrUpdateServiceAccount:

This function creates or updates a Kubernetes ServiceAccount in a specific namespace.
It takes arguments for:
namespace: Namespace where the ServiceAccount should be created.
serviceAccountName: Name of the ServiceAccount resource.
It attempts to create the ServiceAccount using the ServiceAccounts client from the core API.
If the creation fails due to an already existing ServiceAccount (k8serror.IsAlreadyExists), it simply ignores the error as the desired resource already exists.
The function returns any error encountered during ServiceAccount creation other than the already-exists case.
2. CreateOrUpdateClusterRoleBinding:

This function creates or updates a ClusterRoleBinding resource in the Kubernetes cluster.
It takes arguments for:
serviceAccounts: A map where keys are service account names and values are the namespaces where they reside.
clusterRole: Name of the ClusterRole that the Service Accounts will be bound to.
It constructs a list of rbacv1.Subject objects, one for each service account:
Kind is set to "ServiceAccount".
Name is set to the service account name from the map.
Namespace is set to the corresponding namespace from the map (if provided).
It creates a ClusterRoleBinding object with the following details:
Metadata with a name ("vault-role-tokenreview-binding" in this case).
Subjects list containing the constructed service account references.
RoleRef specifying the ClusterRole to bind the service accounts to.
The function attempts to create the ClusterRoleBinding using the ClusterRoleBindings client from the RBAC API.
If creation fails due to an already existing ClusterRoleBinding (k8serror.IsAlreadyExists), it attempts to update the existing resource with the provided details.
The function returns any error encountered during ClusterRoleBinding creation or update other than the already-exists case.
