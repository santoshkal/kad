## This code snippet deals with managing Tekton Project configurations in the store. Here's a breakdown of the functions:

*1. UpsertTektonProject(tektonProject model.TektonProject) error

This function performs an upsert operation on a Tekton Project configuration. It takes a pointer to a model.TektonProject struct containing the project details as input.

Parse GitProjectID:

It attempts to parse the GitProjectId from the input message into a UUID type using uuid.Parse. It returns an error if parsing fails.
Create TektonProject Struct:

If the Id field in the input message is empty, a new TektonProject struct is created with:
ID set to a constant value 1 (likely a placeholder).
GitProjectID set to the parsed UUID value.
Other fields (GitProjectURL, Status, and LastUpdateTime) are copied from the input message.
The function then inserts the newly created record using dbClient.Create.
Update TektonProject Struct (if ID exists):

If the Id field in the input message is not empty, a new TektonProject struct is created with:
GitProjectID set to the parsed UUID value.
Other fields (GitProjectURL, Status, and LastUpdateTime) are copied from the input message.
The function then updates the existing record with ID set to a constant value 1 (likely a placeholder) using dbClient.Update.
2. DeleteTektonProject(id string) error

This function deletes a Tekton Project configuration, but it always attempts to delete the record with a constant ID set to 1. It takes the id (string) as input (which seems unused) and returns an error if deletion fails.

Delete Record:
It attempts to delete the record with ID set to 1 from the database table TektonProject using dbClient.Delete.
Error Handling:
In case of errors during deletion, a custom error is prepared with details about the operation (Delete), the ID (which likely has no effect here), and the original error.
*3. GetTektonProjectForID(id string) (model.TektonProject, error)

This function retrieves a Tekton Project configuration based on its ID (which seems unused). It takes the id (string) as input and returns a pointer to a model.TektonProject struct containing the data or an error.

Find Record:

It creates a new TektonProject struct instance (empty).
It attempts to find a record with ID set to a constant value 1 (likely a placeholder) using dbClient.FindFirst.
Return Data (if found):

If a record is found, a new model.TektonProject struct is created and populated with the data from the retrieved TektonProject struct.
The LastUpdateTime field is converted to a string format before setting it in the struct.
The function returns the populated model.TektonProject struct and nil error.
Return Error (if not found):

If an error occurs during retrieval or no record is found, the function directly returns the error.
*4. GetTektonProject() (model.TektonProject, error)

This function retrieves information about the Tekton project. It calls the updateTektonProject function to perform the actual retrieval and update logic.

*5. updateTektonProject() (model.TektonProject, error)

This function retrieves and updates the Tekton project information.

Find Git Projects by Label:

It retrieves all Git projects with the label "tekton" using GetGitProjectsByLabels.
Handle No Tekton Projects:

If no Git projects are found with the "tekton" label, it returns an error indicating no project found.
Get Tekton Project Git Details:

It retrieves details of the first project from the results obtained in the previous step.
It parses the Id field of the retrieved Git project into a UUID type using uuid.Parse.
Check Existing Tekton Project:

It attempts to get the Tekton project information using GetTektonProjectForID with ID set to a constant value 1 (likely a placeholder).
If the error type is postgresdb.ObjectNotExist, it means no record
