## This code snippet deals with managing Git Project configurations in the store. Here's a breakdown of the functions:

*1. AddGitProject(config captenpluginspb.GitProject) error

This function adds a new Git Project configuration to the store. It takes a pointer to a captenpluginspb.GitProject struct containing the project details as input.

Create GitProject Struct:
A new GitProject struct is created.
Set Fields:
The ID field is set using uuid.MustParse to convert the Id field from the input message to a valid UUID type.
The ProjectURL, Labels, and LastUpdateTime fields are directly copied from the input message.
Store Data:
The newly created GitProject struct is inserted into the database using dbClient.Create.
*2. UpsertGitProject(config captenpluginspb.GitProject) error

This function performs an upsert operation on a Git Project configuration. It takes a pointer to a captenpluginspb.GitProject struct containing the project details as input.

Check for Existing ID:
It checks if the Id field in the input message is empty.
Create New GitProject (if ID is empty):
If the Id is empty, a new GitProject struct is created with a generated UUID using uuid.New for the ID field. Other fields are populated from the input message.
The newly created GitProject struct is then inserted into the database using dbClient.Create.
Update Existing GitProject (if ID is present):
If the Id is present, a new GitProject struct is created with the parsed ID using uuid.MustParse and populated with other fields from the input message.
The existing Git Project record with the matching ID is then updated using dbClient.Update.
3. DeleteGitProjectById(id string) error

This function deletes a Git Project configuration based on its ID. It takes the id (string) as input and returns an error if deletion fails.

Delete Record:
It attempts to delete the record with the matching ID (converted to a UUID type) from the database using dbClient.Delete.
Error Handling:
In case of errors during deletion, a custom error is prepared with details about the operation (Delete), the ID, and the original error.
*4. GetGitProjectForID(id string) (captenpluginspb.GitProject, error)

This function retrieves a specific Git Project configuration based on its ID. It takes the id (string) as input and returns a pointer to a captenpluginspb.GitProject struct containing the data or an error.

Find Record:

It creates a new GitProject struct instance.
It attempts to find a record in the database with the matching ID using dbClient.FindFirst. The ID is converted to a UUID type before searching.
Error Handling:

If an error occurs during retrieval, it directly returns the error.
Populate and Return Data:

If a record is found, a new captenpluginspb.GitProject struct is created and populated with the data from the GitProject struct retrieved from the database.
The LastUpdateTime field is converted to a string format before setting it in the struct.
Finally, the populated captenpluginspb.GitProject struct is returned.
*5. GetGitProjects() ([]captenpluginspb.GitProject, error)

This function retrieves all Git Project configurations stored in the database. It returns a slice of pointers to captenpluginspb.GitProject structs containing the data or an error.

Find All Records:

It retrieves all records of type GitProject from the database using dbClient.Find.
Iterate and Process:

It iterates over the retrieved GitProject slice.
For each record, a new captenpluginspb.GitProject struct is created and populated with the data from the corresponding GitProject struct.
The LastUpdateTime field is converted to a string format before setting it in the struct.
The populated captenpluginspb.GitProject struct is then appended to a slice.
Return Data:

Finally, the slice containing pointers to all captenpluginspb.GitProject structs
