### Function `Start()`
- **Description**: The `Start()` function is the main entry point for initializing and starting the Agent. It performs the following steps:
  1. Retrieves the service configuration.
  2. Configures the PostgreSQL database.
  3. Initializes the Capten store.
  4. Initializes the Agent API.
  5. Listens on a TCP port for incoming connections.
  6. Starts the gRPC server to handle incoming requests.
- **Usage**: This function is called when the Agent starts and is responsible for setting up the environment and starting the server.

### Function `configurePostgresDB()`
- **Description**: The `configurePostgresDB()` function is responsible for setting up the PostgreSQL database by:
  1. Creating the database.
  2. Running migrations to apply any schema changes.
- **Usage**: This function is called during the initialization phase of the application to ensure the database is properly set up before starting other services.

### Function `initializeJobScheduler()`
- **Description**: The `initializeJobScheduler()` function initializes the job scheduler for the Agent. It performs the following tasks:
  1. Creates a new job scheduler.
  2. If the Crossplane Sync Job is enabled, it initializes the job for syncing Crossplane resources.
  3. Adds the job to the scheduler.
  4. Logs the successful initialization of the job scheduler.
  5. Returns the initialized job scheduler.
- **Usage**: This function is called during the startup process to set up and start the job scheduler for executing periodic tasks.

### Function `registerK8SWatcher()`
- **Description**: The `registerK8SWatcher()` function registers a Kubernetes watcher for monitoring Kubernetes resources. It:
  1. Calls the `crossplane.RegisterK8SWatcher()` function to register the watcher.
  2. Returns any error encountered during the registration process.
- **Usage**: This function is used to set up watchers for Kubernetes resources to keep track of changes and events.

These functions are crucial for the proper functioning of the Agent application, handling database setup, job scheduling, Kubernetes resource monitoring, and starting the server to handle incoming requests.
