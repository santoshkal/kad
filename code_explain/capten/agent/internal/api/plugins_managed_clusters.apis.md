# Here is a detailed explanation of the functions and methods in the plugin_managed_clusters_apis.go file:

func (a *Agent) GetManagedClusters(ctx context.Context, request *captenpluginspb.GetManagedClustersRequest) (*captenpluginspb.GetManagedClustersResponse, error): This method is a part of the Agent struct. It handles the logic to get managed clusters. It fetches managed clusters from the database using a.as.GetManagedClusters(). Then, it iterates over the fetched clusters, retrieves the credentials for each cluster, and updates the secret path and secret keys. Finally, it logs the number of managed clusters fetched and returns a response containing the status, message, and the fetched managed clusters.
func (a *Agent) GetManagedClusterKubeconfig(ctx context.Context, request *captenpluginspb.GetManagedClusterKubeconfigRequest) (*captenpluginspb.GetManagedClusterKubeconfigResponse, error): This method is also a part of the Agent struct. It is responsible for getting the kubeconfig for a managed cluster. It validates the request, fetches the credentials for the managed cluster from the vault, and returns the kubeconfig along with the status and message in the response.
These methods are part of the Agent struct in the plugin_managed_clusters_apis.go file and are used for handling requests related to managed clusters and their configurations.
