The GetCaptenPlugins (capten_plugin_apis.go:9-45:2) function in capten_plugin_apis.go serves as a method for the Agent struct. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

Function Signature:
Receiver (a *Agent): The function is associated with an instance of the Agent struct.
Parameters (ctx context.Context, request *captenpluginspb.GetCaptenPluginsRequest): It takes a context and a request object as input.
Returns (*captenpluginspb.GetCaptenPluginsResponse, error): It returns a response object and an error.
Logging:
The function logs a message indicating the receipt of the "Get Capten Plugins" request.
Fetching Apps:
It calls the GetAllApps method on a.as to retrieve a list of applications (res).
If an error occurs during fetching, it logs an error message and returns an error response indicating the failure to fetch plugins.
Processing Apps:
It initializes an empty slice of CaptenPlugin (capten_plugin_apis.go:9-45:2) structs called plugins.
For each app in the fetched list (res), it retrieves the app's configuration.
If the app has a non-empty PluginName, it constructs a CaptenPlugin (capten_plugin_apis.go:9-45:2) struct with details like name, description, icon, endpoints, and statuses. This CaptenPlugin (capten_plugin_apis.go:9-45:2) struct is then added to the plugins slice.
Logging and Response:
It logs the number of Capten plugins fetched successfully.
Finally, it constructs and returns a success response (GetCaptenPluginsResponse (capten_plugins.proto:315-319:2)) containing the status, a success message, and the list of fetched plugins.
In summary, this function processes a request to fetch Capten plugins, retrieves the plugin data, filters out plugins without names, constructs detailed plugin objects, and returns a response with the fetched plugin information.
